# 🎓 Django Portfolio & Standards Artifact System

## Overview
This project is a **Django-based portfolio and artifact management system** designed to organize, display, and evaluate educational or professional work (“artifacts”) across **school years, categories, and standards**.  

It enables educators, organizations, or professionals to:
- Collect artifacts (projects, videos, images, evidence)
- Align them to defined standards and categories
- Organize them by school year or evaluation cycle
- Present them through clean, structured, public-facing views
- Manage everything through Django Admin

The system is **production-ready**, **Dockerized**, and built to scale across institutions or businesses.
